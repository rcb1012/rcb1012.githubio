            <p class="letter">Happy Birthday!! To be honest, I don't know what else I could give you that can make you more happy. I miss you po! (kiss kiss)</p>
            <p class="letter">It has already been almost 3 years since we've known each other. I remember the first time we went out, you were a bit hesistant to go on a second date with me, but here we are now! haha</p>
            <p class="letter">You still can back out if you want to, haha. But seriously, thank you baby po for being the perfect partner for me.</p>
            <p class="letter">For being so patient, and for always trying to understand even if it does not make sense to you. I know that things always happen for a reason, and I know the path I chose was not the easiest one, but as long as we don't give up, we can get through it together.</p>
            <p class="letter">But before that, enjoy your birthday with your friends there. Soon you won't be seeing them again, so make the most out of it</p>
            <p class="letter">I hope you enjoy your birthday po, I love you!</p>
